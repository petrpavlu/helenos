Important notes for maintenance of this library
-----------------------------------------------

This directory contains PCUT [1], a library for simple unit testing of C
code.

If you want to update PCUT to the latest revision, run

./update-from-master.sh really-overwrite

and commit the changes.

Please, never update sources here without updating them in upstream too.
Especially, do not try to fix PCUT formatting and special pragmas to fit
with the rest of HelenOS.  They are there for a reason ;-). And it makes
reviewing the changes after updates really painful.

If you do not have write access to upstream, please, open a pull-request
or an issue on GitHub [2].
